            I am not a killer.
                Only you could make those words cute.
                Hello, Dexter Morgan.
                I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing.
                You? Only you could make those words cute.

            I like seafood.
                I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece.
                And I'm not even sure what the picture should be.
                I have a dark side, too.
                Tell him time is of the essence.

Makes me a … scientist. I have a dark side, too. Like a sloth. I can do that. Makes me a … scientist. I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see.
